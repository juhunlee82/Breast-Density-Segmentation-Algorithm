## What this repository offer
This repository is about breast density segmentation algorithms developed from my lab using deep convolutional networks on large mammogram dataset included full-field digital screening mammograms of 604 women, which included 1208 mediolateral oblique (MLO) and 1208 craniocaudal (CC) views from University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC).

The algorithm takes the size of 227 x 227 pixels of mammogram images as input and it returns the segmentation outcome with the size of 227 x 227 pixels.
The segmentation outcome consists of three channel, Red, Green, Blue indicate background, fatty, and dense tissue. 
As anatomical structure of CC and MLO view are different, we developed two models, one for CC-view and another MLO-view. 

For CC-view, it segments dense, fatty, and background. It removes any additional tissue (e.g., belly, axilar), if they are visible in the mammogramm.
The below figure shows the input CC-view and its outcome from our segmentation algorithm.

For MLO-view, it segments dense, fatty, and background. It removes pectoral muscle and any additional tissue not belong to breast.
The below figure shows the input MLO-view and its outcome from our segmentation algorithm.

The algorithm developed on MATLAB environment. We used SegNet architecture, trained on 1208 CC and 1208 MLO view of full-field digital screening mammograms of 604 women.

## How to use our algorithm
Download our weights available at: [Mammo-Dense-SegNet Weights](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iEz8bJjITJo68QC6Pko2ivjQ7zXHSCuD/view?usp=drive_link)

Load the network weight, a target mammogram image, and then apply it using MATLAB function semnaticseg:
```matlab
load SegNet_227x227_CC_v2_e10.mat; % CC view model
img = imread('mammogram_test_CC.jpg');
segimg = semanticseg(img,net);
% display the segmentation result
figure(1);
subplot(121); imshow(img);
subplot(122); imshow(segimg);
```
